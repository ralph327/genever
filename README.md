genever 
========
This is based off of github.com/codegangsa/gin. Genever will be used as part of a framework. Rather than installing gin as a separate program, genever will be baked into a web app.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working Go environment and `GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH`, `genever` is a breeze to install:

~~~ shell
go get github.com/ralph327/genever

## Usage
Create a file similar to genever.go in the source of your web app.
